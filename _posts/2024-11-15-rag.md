tags: [GenAI, RAG, LLM, ChatGPT, LangChain, Python]

---

This use case demonstrates the cutting-edge utility of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI models that leverage the large language models (LLMs) that we are all growning to love (and depend upon). This particular case uses ChatGPT-5 (current now but likely outdated by the time you're reading this).

**Generative AI: AI techniques that learn from existing artifacts to generate new, realistic content (images, text, audio, code) that reflects the characteristics of the training data but does not repeat it.**


```
python -m pip install python-docx
```                                                                     
We ran this command above in our Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) ("C:\Users\YOURACCOUNTNAME>") - if running Python through Anaconda, then use the Anaconda prompt and the command below:

```
conda install -c conda-forge python-docx
```

```
pip install python-docx

### How to Interpret the Output

| **Score** | **Alignment** | **Description** |
|:---:|:---|:---|
|0.80 - 1.00|Highly Aligned|The documents are likely talking about the exact same topics, perhaps even reusing the same paragraphs.|
|0.50 - 0.79|Moderately Aligned|They share the same context (e.g., both are about "Corporate Strategy" or "Q3 Goals"), but the specific content differs.|
| 0.20 - 0.49|Loosely Related|They might share a domain (e.g., "Business"), but the topics don't overlap much.|
|< 0.20|Unrelated|One is about Strategy, the other is likely about something completely different, like a lunch menu or unrelated IT logs.|
