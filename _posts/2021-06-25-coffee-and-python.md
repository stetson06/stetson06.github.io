# This project
## is all about
### how much
#### I LOVE
##### Python & Coffee!

---

Firstly, I love Python so much, here is some code!

```
my_love_for_python = 0
my_python_knowledge = 0

for day in lifetime:
    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1
```

Just so you really see how much I love Python, here is some code BUT with some colors for keywords & functionality!

```python
my_love_for_python = 0
my_python_knowledge = 0

for day in lifetime:
    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1  
```

Here is an **unordered list** showing some things I love about Python:

* For my work
    * Data Analysis
    * Data Visualization
    * Machine Learning
* For fun
    * Deep Learning
    * Computer Vision
    * Projects about coffee

Here is an _ordered list_ showing some things I love about coffee:

1. The smell at all times of the day, but especially in the morning
2. The taste
3. The fact I can run the 100m in approx. 9 seconds after having 4 cups in quick succession!

I love Python & Coffee so much, here is that picture from the top of my project AGAIN, but this time, in the BODY of my project!

The above image is just linked to the actual file in my Github, but I could also link to images online, using the URL!

A line break, like this one below - helps me make sense of what I'm reading, especially when I've had so much coffee that my vision goes a little blurry.
